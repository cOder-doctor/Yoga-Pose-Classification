# Yoga-Pose-Classification

Yoga is a popular form of exercise currently practiced worldwide due to it’s spiritual
and physical health benefits. However, incorrect yoga posture can cause
physical injuries, which makes the practice require guidance of expert practitioners.
With the recent development of digital health and fitness technologies,
automated yoga pose classification has become a significant area of research to
mitigate costs and increase accessibility of the practice. Human pose keypoint
extraction models have made significant advancements in human pose classification,
but yoga pose recognition systems using these state-of-the-art models
remain relatively underexplored in spite of the potential improvements. This
study aims to address this gap by performing a comprehensive comparative analysis
of deep learning approaches, focusing on the integration of skeleton-based
representations derived from different pose estimation models. We introduced a
curated dataset, “Yoga-16”, which mitigates limitations in the existing datasets
and also evaluates the performance of VGG16, ResNet50 and Xception architecture
with three input scenarios: direct image, MediaPipe Pose skeleton image,
and YOLOv8 Pose skeleton image. Our experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of skeleton-based representations, with the highest accuracy of 96.09%
achieved by VGG16 with Mediapipe pose skeleton image input.
